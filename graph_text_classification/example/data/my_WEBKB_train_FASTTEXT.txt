book revised substantially since last course offering book large pages reading screen apt tiresome inconvenient book taken exams whereas Mac cannot Course Assumptions Students first course computing college level Prior experience preferred although not essential using number different languages including Java simplified derivative possible only knowledge Pascal rather start fine long language syntax know procedures arrays types minimum unfamiliar please take first Programming Course sense much course entails programming However consider exposure computer science ideas important part intent programming assignments drive home key ideas Lectures word lecture used loosely expect lecture periods include traditional style lecturing hope like multilogue set dialogues expected attend ask

loved ones slaying one another people love everyone meet close relationship victim killer typical murder many cases nearly third total authorities simply cannot determine relationship Next unknown

applications include financial management historical analysis economic social sciences metereology medical sciences biological sciences Existing relational databases inadequate regard data collections treated sets not sequences Consequently expressing sequence queries tedious evaluating inefficient Databases model data using abstraction sequences allow data sequences queried declarative manner utilizing ordered semantics take advantage unique opportunities available query optimization evaluation integrate sequence data relational data users store query combination relation sequences requirements serve goals SEQ project Various kinds sequences need supported temporal sequences important kind Queries expressible using notions like next previous natural considering sequences queries optimized evaluated efficiently issues need studied theory database system needs built demonstrates feasibility theoretical ideas Project Status current status project defined SEQ data model support important kinds sequence data also defined algebraic query operators composed form sequence queries analogous composition relational algebra operators form relation queries described sequence queries efficiently processed identified various optimization techniques use sequence query language Sequin declaratively express queries sequences Sequin query include embedded expressions relational query

phenomena sequentiality occurrence phenomena various meteorological events sequenced time recorded scientist asks query volcano eruptions recent earthquake strength greater Richter scale query expressed relational query language like SQL complex features like groupby clauses correlated subqueries aggregate functions required conventional relational query optimizer would not find efficient query execution plan even given knowledge Earthquakes Volcano relations sorted time However efficient plan exists one models data sequences ordered time two sequences scanned lock step similar sort merge join recent earthquake record scanned stored temporary buffer Whenever volcano record processed value recent earthquake record stored buffer checked see strength greater possibly generating answer query therefore processed single scan two sequences using little memory key optimization sequentiality data query Data Model details SEQ data model described published paper click postscript version present gist basic model sequence set records mapped ordered domain positions many many relationship records positions viewed two dual distinct ways set records mapped position set positions mapped record two views called Positional Record Oriented respectively gives rise set query operators based view Queries sequences could require operators either flavors Record Oriented operators similar relational operators include various kinds joins overlap containment etc aggregates operators extensively explored researchers temporal database community Positional operators include Next Previous Offset Moving Aggregates etc operators allow zooming operations sequences means collapsing expanding ordering domains associated sequence instance daily sequence could zoomed collapsed weekly sequence zoomed expanded hourly sequence last part model deals operations groups sets sequences advantage makes easy model queries involving sequence collections case many real world situations sequence operators extended work groups similar sequences instead single sequences extension SEQ model indicates practical implementation SEQ would probably involve nested complex object system Sequin Query Language devised query language called Sequin using declarative sequence queries specified language similar flavor SQL except inputs queries well results queries sequences Click description

Index Maruti Release Announcement Recent publications Recent accomplishments Maruti Background Maruti Design Goals Design Approach Principles Maruti Personnel Maruti System Architecture Background purpose Maruti project create environment development deployment critical applications hard real time constraints reactive environment applications must able execute platform consisting distributed heterogeneous resources operate continuously presence faults Maruti project started first version system designed object oriented system suitable extensions objects support real time operation proof concept version design implemented run top Unix operating system supported hard non real time applications running distributed heterogeneous environment feasibility fault tolerant concepts incorporated design Maruti system also demonstrated changes Unix kernel made implementation operational realized Unix not hospitable host real time applications little control use resources exercised system without extensive modifications kernel Therefore based lessons learned first design proceeded design current version Maruti changed implementation base CMU Mach permitted direct control resources recently implemented Maruti directly hardware providing Maruti applications total control resources initial version distributed Maruti also implemented allowing Maruti applications run across network synchronized hard real time manner Design Goals design real time system must take consideration primary characteristics applications supported design Maruti guided following application characteristics requirements Real Time Requirements important requirement real time systems capability support timely execution applications contrast many existing systems next generation systems require support hard soft non real time applications platform Fault Tolerance Many mission critical systems safety critical therefore fault tolerance requirements context fault tolerance ability system support continuous operation presence faults Although number techniques supporting fault tolerant systems suggested literature rarely consider real time requirements system real time operating system must provide support fault tolerance exception handling capabilities increased reliability continuing satisfy timing requirements inherent characteristics many systems require multiple autonomous computers connected local area network cooperate distributed manner computers resources system may homogeneous heterogeneous Due autonomous operation components cooperate system control coordination becomes much difficult task system implemented centralized manner techniques learned design implementation centralized systems not always extend distributed systems straightforward manner Many real time applications undergo different modes operation life cycle scenario defines set jobs executing system given time hard real time system must capable switching one scenario another maintaining system safe stable state times without violating timing constraints Integration Multiple Requirements major challenge building operating systems mission critical computing integration multiple requirements conflicting nature requirements solutions developed date integration requirements single system formidable task example real time requirements use many fault handling techniques used fault tolerant systems Design Approach Principles Maruti time based system resources reserved prior execution resource reservation done time line thus allowing reasoning real time properties natural way time driven architecture provides predictable execution real time systems necessary requirement critical applications requiring hard real time performance basic design approach outlined Resource Reservation Hard Real Time Jobs Hard real time applications Maruti advance resource reservation resulting priori guarantees timely execution hard real time jobs achieved calendar data structure keeps track resource assigned time intervals resource requirements specified early possible development stage application manipulated analyzed refined phases application development Reduction Resource Contention Hard real time jobs scheduled using time driven scheduling paradigm resource contention jobs eliminated scheduling results reduced run time overheads leads high degree predictability However not jobs pre scheduled Since resources may shared jobs calendar jobs system non real time activities may resource contention leading lack predictability eliminating much resource contention possible reducing whenever not possible eliminate entirely lack predictability allowing enough slack schedule Integrated Support Fault Tolerance Fault tolerance objectives achieved integrating support fault tolerance levels system design Fault tolerance supported early fault detection handling resilient application structures redundancy capability switch modes operation Fault detection capabilities integrated application development permitting use application specific fault detection fault handling fault handling may result violation temporal constraints replication used make application resilient Failure replica may not affect timely execution thereby operation system may controlling anticipated load failure conditions may become necessary system guarantees given hard real time applications change mode operation dynamically acceptable degraded mode operation may continue Separation Mechanism Policy design Maruti emphasis placed separating mechanism policy Thus instance system provides basic mechanisms time driven system keeping design specific scheduling policies separate approach followed aspects system separating mechanism policy system tailored optimized different environments Portability Extensibility Unlike many real time systems aim Maruti project develop system tailored use wide variety situations small embedded systems complex mission critical systems rapid change hardware technology imperative design portable different platforms makes minimal assumptions underlying hardware platform Portability extensibility also enhanced using modular design well defined interfaces allows integration new techniques design relative ease Support Hard Soft Non Real Time Environment Many critical systems consist applications mix hard soft non real time requirements Since may sharing data resources must execute within environment approach taken Maruti support integrated execution applications multiple requirements reducing bounding unpredictable interaction Support Distributed Operation Many embedded systems need several processors carry computations multiple processors function autonomously use hard real time applications requires operating system support coordinated resource management Maruti provides coordinated time based resource management resources distributed environment including processors communication channels Support Multiple Execution Environments Maruti provides support multiple execution environments facilitate program development well execution Real time applications may execute Maruti Mach Maruti Standalone

Database Order Time put Database Time put Database Order Document Contents Project Objectives Current Status Motivating Example SEQ Data Model Sequin Query Language Optimization Techniques SEQ System Development Publications Related Work Contact Information Project Objectives number important database applications require processing large amounts ordered sequence data domains applications include financial management historical analysis economic social sciences metereology medical sciences biological sciences Existing relational databases inadequate regard data collections treated sets not sequences Consequently expressing sequence queries tedious evaluating inefficient Databases model data using abstraction sequences allow data sequences queried declarative manner utilizing ordered semantics take advantage unique opportunities available query optimization evaluation integrate sequence data relational data users store query combination relation sequences requirements serve goals SEQ project Various kinds sequences need supported temporal sequences important kind Queries expressible using notions like next previous natural considering sequences queries optimized evaluated efficiently issues need studied theory database system needs built demonstrates feasibility theoretical ideas Project Status current status project defined SEQ data model support important kinds sequence data also defined algebraic query operators composed form sequence queries analogous composition relational algebra operators form relation queries described sequence queries efficiently processed identified various optimization techniques use sequence query language Sequin declaratively express queries sequences Sequin query include embedded expressions relational query language like SQL vice versa building disk based database system demonstrate feasibility proposals system implements SEQ model using nested complex object architecture built SHORE storage manager process several megabytes data Relations sequences supported integrated extensible manner Motivating Example Sequence Query weather monitoring system records information various meteorological phenomena sequentiality occurrence phenomena various meteorological events sequenced time recorded scientist asks query volcano eruptions recent earthquake strength greater Richter scale query expressed relational query language like SQL complex features like groupby clauses correlated subqueries aggregate functions required conventional relational query optimizer would not find efficient query execution plan even given knowledge Earthquakes Volcano relations sorted time However efficient plan exists one models data sequences ordered time two sequences scanned lock step similar sort merge join recent earthquake record scanned stored temporary buffer Whenever volcano record processed value recent earthquake record stored buffer checked see strength greater possibly generating answer query therefore processed single scan two sequences using little memory key optimization sequentiality data query Data Model details SEQ data model described published paper click postscript version present gist basic model sequence set records mapped ordered domain positions many many relationship records positions viewed two dual distinct ways set records mapped position set positions mapped record two views called Positional Record Oriented respectively gives rise set query operators based view Queries sequences could require operators either flavors Record Oriented operators similar relational operators include various kinds joins overlap containment etc aggregates operators extensively explored researchers temporal database community Positional operators include Next Previous Offset Moving Aggregates etc operators allow zooming operations sequences means collapsing expanding ordering domains associated sequence instance daily sequence could zoomed collapsed weekly sequence zoomed expanded hourly sequence last part model deals operations groups sets sequences advantage makes easy model queries involving sequence collections case many real world situations sequence operators extended work groups similar sequences instead single sequences extension SEQ model indicates practical implementation SEQ would probably involve nested complex object system Sequin Query Language devised query language called Sequin using declarative sequence queries specified language similar flavor SQL except inputs queries well results queries sequences Click description Sequin language examples Optimization Techniques proposed new optimization techniques sequence queries involving Positional operators existing techniques proposed queries Record Oriented operators optimizations use query transformations meta data caching intermediate results efficiently evaluate query optimal query evaluation plan generated using algorithm relies cost estimates One important observations accessing sequence data single stream probably efficient evaluation strategies take account details optimization techniques described published paper click postscript version System Development SEQ

constructing model process something model called algorithm Furthermore programmer concerned not only whether program simply works also well works interacts users programs class designed mainly teach art computer programming end shall try develop sense style aesthetics help guide programming efforts shall try develop intuition things work learn design principles engineering good programs shall teach little computer science give way analyzing programs algorithms finding means improve learn number standard algorithms programming idioms standard ways performing certain kinds tasks programming need choose language choose language not place limits programs only look like provides framework organize ideas processes problem solving programming language use class Scheme chosen provides convenient mechanism describing idioms processes programmers found useful spend much time teaching details language find easy pick along often helpful first program using simple powerful language like Scheme even one must translate solution traditional programming language like simplicity Scheme allows treat many computer science topics depth would possible used traditional languages detail must mastered Scheme allows give better impression true joys challenges programming better position study next computer science course Finally computer programming still fairly young field lost sense fun lots people including hope enjoy much Goals end course student expected know following concepts able write good Scheme programs students able use following data types symbols numbers lists vectors matrices strings characters students know write programs recursive iterative imperative styles Students able write recursive programs lists containing only top level items containing nested tree recursion students able use procedures first class objects pass arguments also write programs whose values procedures includes composing procedures students understand concept scope environment able use locally defined procedures Students able use abstraction data making programs independent data representation also procedures structure programs Students able use input output routines write convenient user interfaces programs Students able handle binary representation numbers Students know standard sorting routines insertion sort log understand advantages disadvantages also able write linear binary search programs Students know mutate various data structures including lists vectors strings addition understand side effecting variables Students able read programs appreciation constitutes good programming style aware relative efficiency programs Certain topics included time permits include things writing using syntactic extensions developing object oriented programming package Scheme using streams Literate programming Every programmer knows programs must comprehensible computer programming language implementation not practice generally easy solve problems less appreciated programs must also comprehensible programmer Otherwise programmer cannot confidence program correct program may easily comprehensible computer not intended only programmer knows intended cases also essential programs comprehensible programmers Though not typical student programming experience real world programmers spend time modifying huge programs developed long period time many programmers someone else code even months later may joy nightmare depending clearly program written Thus emphasize importance literate programming programs easy understand relative difficulty problem solve Literate programming almost always important programming goals efficiency code compactness though efficiency compactness often literate programming Course Materials Required Springer Friedman

submitted early early days subsequent late days may charged without penalty GRAPHICS REQUIREMENTS GENERAL OVERVIEW objective requirements allow design implement basic useful three dimensional graphics package Emphasis given fundamental computer graphics elements common general purpose computer graphics packages course not emphasize documentation software design nor emphasize user interfaces appropriate subjects courses obvious importance goal course allow gain understanding important fundamental algorithms techniques used computer graphics warning wise concerning things pleasant experience course First scan ahead read parts text something implementation saves realizing road architecture package cannot easily accommodate new capability must incorporated Understand elements fit together start Design package ahead time task though time consuming saves lot headaches later simply not enough time semester finish package wait concept discussed class begin think implement philosophy may odd only way produce good package class given unavoidable time constraints common university courses actual production environments Second start early pass deadlines come fast Try always keep couple weeks ahead caught short time left end semester meet responsibilities Third make code robust Use good sense knowledge good program design Finally not limit course textbook Read texts material may give information subject explain better sources great value implementation LANGUAGES Students may use machines languages capable accommodating package requirements authorized access make pass offs manageable must pass package computer located BYU campus authorized access develop package computer home please make sure compatible computer run package campus Otherwise necessity transporting computer campus pass might not convenient unless computer laptop display device capable displaying least different colors resolution least pixels Several department machines available SGI TMCB machines choice Info TMCB MAC TMCB priority UNIX systems TMCB INTERFACE static demo NOT sufficient pass implementation must somewhat interactive objective pass demonstrate robustness implementation performing arbitrary graphics functions several options may choose depending preferences development environment GUI may use mouse keyboard menus dialogs controls wish However not required assumed interface intuitive supported commands optional parameters tested using GUI Script File may create process simple script file demonstrate functionality software Please provide syntax sample commands processed script file supported commands optional parameters tested editing script files processing Command Line may use command line interface choose option please include ability print commands parameters simple help screen supported commands optional parameters tested using command line interface least convenient implementation one week pass supply students pass sign sheet required turn electronic copy code However special code documentation requirements GRADING PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS assignment must completed due date late days charged indicates functions must provide required functionality must completed balance points section may earned completing optional items listed category may also propose additional options writing approved advance may count toward total optional points points four phases total possible points Note phase gives three different options choose option worth points Choose only one points may deducted assignment interface not facilitate adequate testing functionality example drawing line must accept start end points functionality supported width color etc Points awarded based sophistication elegance functionality USE OPERATING GRAPHICS phase primitives only operating system primitives may use draw individual pixels clear screen restriction applies only graphics code specified assignment user interface may use operating system library support available make job easier phase later may use built operating system library primitives draw lines circles polygons etc concentrate implementing higher level functionality called assignments RESOURCES Many options programmed using only information text book Following option page numbers text book cover listed parenthesis options especially phase text book insufficient detail allow program without using outside resources reference books cited prove helpful library many graphics books would helpful also IMPORTANT NOTE not graphics books available library shelf graphics books kept behind locked doors include CDs disks ask get check Feel free come see office hours additional help programming assignments class heavy deadlines come quickly important not get stuck procrastinate working assignment deadline reach point not sure proceed much better get help right away get going rather wait deadline panic sets may late catch
