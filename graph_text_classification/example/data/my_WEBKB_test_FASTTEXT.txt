implement evaluate persistent object system serve needs wide variety target applications including hardware software CAD systems persistent programming languages geographic information systems satellite data repositories multi media applications basic capabilities widely used EXODUS Storage Manager developed Wisconsin funded ARPA number ways including support typed objects multiple programming languages Unix like hierarchical name space named objects Unix compatible interface objects text field interface intended ease transition applications Unix file system environment existing Unix tools able store data objects without modification basically Unix file becomes either single object text field complex object Overview SHORE something hybrid system nature characteristics object oriented database systems file systems section briefly describe basic features SHORE paper Shoring Persistent Applications describes SHORE much greater detail SHORE three major goals Scalability Support hardware language heterogeneity Support existing file based applications SHORE project began years ago goals unique among research commercial OODBMS community effort also concentrated providing degree support language heterogeneity turn facilitates hardware heterogeneity SHORE remains distinguished focus scalability support applications depend Unix file system persistent storage Furthermore since SHORE data model basically compatible data model expect much technology develop eventually transferred commercial sector Scalable Architecture SHORE software architecture unique several ways First SHORE uses symmetric peer peer distributed architecture SHORE every participating processor runs SHORE server process whether not processor SHORE data disks attached software designed scalable run single processor network workstations large parallel processor Intel Paragon IBM design contrast client server architecture used EXODUS OODBMS vendors client server architecture fine design environment typically used software hardware CAD efforts not scalable second unique feature SHORE architecture notion value added server structuring software runs server extensibility mind relatively simple users build application specific servers example Paradise project already using SHORE server build geographic information system NASA EOSDIS project feel two unique pieces technology play important role variety future research commercial example digital libraries future almost certainly depend availability scalable persistent object technology systems going store retrieve manipulate transmit objects containing video pictures well text current OODBMS products could used systems oriented toward dealing gigabytes not data equally important indexing retrieval query processing mechanisms needed digital library different required geographic information system Language Hardware Heterogeneity Objects SHORE typed SHORE provides single language type system used define types SHORE objects type system SHORE Data Language language SHORE object types defined enhances OMG data model IDL support database features bulk types sets lists persistence provision typed persistent objects simplifies task supporting heterogeneous hardware environments makes feasible support access persistent objects multiple programming languages key objective SHORE project mentioned earlier quite closely related language object type definition language recently proposed standard OODB vendor consortium terms emphasis however largely concentrated providing standardized interface existing oriented OODBs focus support inter language object sharing within large name space objects Support Existing File based Applications major goal SHORE enable applications currently use byte oriented files persistent data data time accessed stop applications able store data typed structured objects convenient type safe intra inter program data sharing ultimate hope SHORE byte oriented file systems Unix file system SHORE provides two major services file system standpoint First support object naming space management world many persistent objects SHORE provides flexible tree structured Unix like name space persistent objects reachable either directly indirectly gives SHORE users familiar framework register individual persistent objects termed registered objects roots large persistent data structures bulk sets objects termed anonymous objects realization framework involves several different kinds SHORE file system objects including directories pools files containing anonymous objects symbolic links cross references SHORE provides two mechanisms ease transition legacy Unix applications compilers editors CAD systems traditional byte stream files SHORE First applications linked SHORE provides standard Unix compatible file system interface open close read write order make access SHORE objects via Unix file system calls possible SHORE object type optionally one variable length byte string character string attribute object object Unix data Programs attempt read object SHORE Unix file system calls only see portion object legacy programs wish without linked possible NFS mount SHORE file system access Unix data contained objects directly makes feasible new old applications access set objects old applications only access Unix data component

Efficiency unnecessarily inefficient algorithms constructs However efficiency never pursued expense clarity Modularity program modular make effective use parameters Completeness incorporate information program need sort extra paper documentation Generality program general possible subject consideration efficiency clarity avoid arbitrary limitations bound size complexity input whenever possible limitations necessary expressed defined constants near top program easily changed only numeric appear program values not likely change Style Use meaningful names Use consistent naming scheme
